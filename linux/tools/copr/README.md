Copr is an easy-to-use automatic build system providing a package repository as its output.

Start with making your own repository in these three steps:

choose a system and architecture you want to build for
provide Copr with src.rpm packages available online
let Copr do all the work and wait for your new repo

NOTE: Copr is not yet officially supported by Fedora Infrastructure.
