LBYL

Look Before You leap

```
if( error state1 ) { 
    do something... 
} else if( error state2 ) { 
    do something... 
}
```

> A common idiom in other languages, sometimes known as "look before you leap" (LBYL), is to check in advance, before attempting an operation, for all circumstances that might make the operation invalid.
